# 🌡️ DHT11-Temperature-and-Humidity-sensor-in-the-Cloud 🌫️

Harnessing the capabilities of DHT11, this project is dedicated to capturing temperature and humidity data, and then seamlessly pushing it into the cloud. Leveraging the prowess of the Raspberry Pi as the hardware interface, data is efficiently sent to both Firebase and ThingSpeak platforms for storage and visualization.

## 📋 Project Highlights:

- **Sensor**: Utilizes the DHT11 sensor for capturing real-time temperature and humidity readings.
- **Platform Interface**: Uses Raspberry Pi as the main interface to interact with the DHT11 sensor.
- **Cloud Storage**: The captured data is reliably sent to Firebase for secure storage.
- **Visualization**: Real-time data can be accessed and visualized on the ThingSpeak IoT platform. Check out [thingspeak.com](https://thingspeak.com) for live data.
